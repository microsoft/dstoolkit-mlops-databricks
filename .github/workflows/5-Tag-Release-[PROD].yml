# When The Release Branch Is Tagged With A Version Number, The Release Branch Code Is
# Deployed To The Production Environment
# Pipeline Is Triggered When ANY Branch Is Tagged EXCLUDING Main, Thereby Ensuring Only Release Is Used, 
# Given That We Never Tag Feature Branches .

# If A New Release Branch Is Created Then Branch Name In The File Needs To Be Updated. (Need To Find A Dynamic Way To Do This)

# git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "my version 1.0.1"
# git tag -l
# git push origin v1.0.1
# git tag -d v1.0.1

# Create A RELEASE in Github GUI and Create Tag on Release Branch ( Create Security Rule That Only Allow Release Branch to be Tagged). 
# The Tag Will Trigger This Pipeline. 
# TO DO :: CHANGE TO ON RELEASE - See if github.ref == branch name. .
